# Pdf2Dom

[![Maven Check](https://github.com/se-be/Pdf2Dom/actions/workflows/maven-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/se-be/Pdf2Dom/actions/workflows/maven-check.yml)

This project is a fork of [Pdf2Dom](https://github.com/radkovo/Pdf2Dom) from [radkovo](https://github.com/radkovo) which is not highly maintained anymore.
The point of this fork is to update Pdf2Dom to work with [pdfbox](https://github.com/apache/pdfbox) version 3 API.

In order to do that I had to "disable" font conversion as it was using [FontVerter](https://github.com/m-abboud/FontVerter) which is also not working with fontbox version 3.

## Description from the original project.

Pdf2Dom is a PDF parser that converts the documents to a HTML DOM representation. The obtained DOM tree may be then
serialized to a HTML file or further processed. The inline CSS definitions contained in the resulting document are
used for making the HTML page as similar as possible to the PDF input. A command-line utility for converting the PDF
documents to HTML is included in the distribution package. Pdf2Dom may be also used as an independent Java library
with a standard DOM interface for your DOM-based applications. 

Pdf2Dom is based on the Apache PDFBoxâ„¢ library.

See also the [Pdf2Dom-lite](https://github.com/radkovo/Pdf2Dom-lite) fork that provides a lightweight version 
of Pdf2Dom with no font decoding support but significantly reduced dependencies.
